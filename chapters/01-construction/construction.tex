\chapter{Knowledge Graph Construction}
\todo{TODO FINISH}
Knowledge Graphs can be constructed mainly virtualization and ETL.
In this chapter, we discuss data virtualization and the subsequent materialization based on it.
Contributions: Virtualization and Materialization of OpenStreetMap, a large spatial knowledge base.

%    \item How well does virtualization of (spatial) relational databases perform and what are strengths and limitations?
%    \item To what extent can we leverage (map-reduced-based) Big Data technology, such as Apache Spark?
%    \item How can we leverage either approach to create summarization meta data from large RDF datasets, such as VoID descriptions?
